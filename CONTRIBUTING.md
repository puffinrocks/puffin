## Running your own Puffin

You can run your own Puffin for yourself and your friends.

First you need to do is to is to install Docker on your server - the easiest way to
achieve that is via [Docker Machine](README.md#docker-machine).
Next you need to run Puffin [Production Deployment](README.md#production-deployment).

If you run into any trouble, please visit the [Forum Hosting Section](http://forum.puffin.rocks/t/hosting).

Keep in mind the software is in early alpha development stage, so for the moment it should be used for
experimentation only.
